    <p>The alert() function in JavaScript does not return any value. Its return value is always undefined. This is because alert() is primarily designed for displaying messages to the user and does not take input or provide an output.</p>

    <script>
        let msg = alert("how are you");
        console.log(msg);  // undefined 
    </script>
